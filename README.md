# CECI-site

## About  
This project is a Django-Website created for CECI-Formation in 2018, to improve communication between students ant teachers.
Since the project went offline in 2022, I can now make it Opensource.

It includes the following features: 
- Document sharing
- User, userGroups, Documents and DocumentGroups management, to allow each user to access documents he is allowed to access in function of his formation, and his level
- Excel-based user import
- Basic theme management, based on user group
- Administration backoffice, to allow non-technical user to manage the website
- Exam result system, to import exam results as an Excel Spreadsheet (TOEIC/WiDaF), and automatically send result to each registered student
- Exam inviation, to send to eligible students (based on userGroup), invitation to participate in an exam, with a link for the student to confirm his attendance.
